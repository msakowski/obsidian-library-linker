Add option to reconvert existing jwlibrary:// links

Users can now enable a new "Reconvert existing links" setting to update already-converted jwlibrary:// links according to their current formatting preferences. This is useful when changing book name length, prefixes/suffixes, or other link styling options, allowing users to standardize all existing links across their notes to match the latest settings.
