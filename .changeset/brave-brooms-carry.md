Fix Korean Bible book names

Updated Korean Bible book names to match correct translations:

- Fixed medium and short forms for books with mismatches
- Added proper spacing in compound book names (e.g., '고린도 전서' instead of '고린도전서')
- Corrected specific book names like '솔로몬의 노래' for Song of Songs
- Updated abbreviations like '욘' for Jonah and '슥' for Zechariah
- Standardized format for numbered books (e.g., '요한 1서' instead of '요한1서')

This addresses user feedback about incorrect Korean Bible book names and ensures proper recognition of Korean Bible references.
