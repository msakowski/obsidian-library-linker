   (better suggestions while typing are in the doing)
3. Select the desired option from the suggestions to either create a link or create and open the link

**Silent mode**

1. Enter the Bible reference (e.g., `matth√§us 24:14` or `joh 3:16` or `off21:3`).  
   Once there is a valid reference possible the suggestion opens.
